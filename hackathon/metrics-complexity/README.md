Code complexity metrics
=======================

Calculates some totally non-scientific metrics roughly based on cyclomatic complexity and draws some line charts in SVG format.

Call `make` for help.

All `*.py` files in the 101repo (which is expected to live at `../../../101repo`) are files taken into consideration if you call one of the targets in the Makefile.

Yes, I know the code was written in rather quick and even more dirty.
